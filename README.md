# Choice Picker

This project is a responsive app to pick randomly choices developed with Bulma and vanillaJS using Webpack.

### Usage:
Just add your choices separated by a dot and press the 'Enter' key or the 'Random choice' button on mobile devices when you are done.
There must be 2 tags at least and can't be repeated.
You can remove tags erasing them at the Textarea or pressing the close button on the top right corner of each tag.
Change to dark mode if you prefer, pressing the mode-icon situated on the bottom of the screen.

### Notes:
Remember to rebuild node_modules:
```
npm install
```

And build the dist directory:
```
npm run build
```
